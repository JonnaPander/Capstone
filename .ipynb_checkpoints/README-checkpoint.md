## Project: Nearby Venues and Real Estate Prices in Santa Clara County, California

**Do you have data fully in hand and if not, what blockers are you facing?** <br>
Yes. Finding suitable data took forever. Data includes:<br>  
- List of cities in Santa Clara County via web scraping - Wikipedia, Santa Clara County Home Sales 2019<br>
- Home sales prices transferred to csv from a pdf: https://www.sccaor.com/pdf/stats/2019.pdf<br>   
- Nearby venues via API - Foursquare<br>

**Have you done a full EDA on all of your data?** 
No.  Need to explore housing prices in relation to nearby venues further.<br>        

**Have you begun the modeling process? How accurate are your predictions so far?**     
Yes. I'm doing a combination of K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis. I have not run PCA yet and don't have an assessment of accuracy.<br>

**What blockers are you facing, including processing power, data acquisition, modeling difficulties, data cleaning, etc.? How can we help you overcome those challenges?** 
I think I'm on the right track now. It took forever to decide on and find data I wanted to use.<br> 
  
**Have you changed topics since your lightning talk? Since you submitted your Problem Statement and EDA? If so, do you have the necessary data in hand (and the requisite EDA completed) to continue moving forward?**
Yes, I have changed topics. New Project: How do surrounding venues correlate with real estate prices of single-family homes in Santa Clara County, CA.      
I have all of the data I need at this point.<br>  

**What is your timeline for the next week and a half? What do you have to get done versus what would you like to get done?**
Build out the PCA model and go back and cleanup code.<br>    

**What topics do you want to discuss during your 1:1?**   
Am I missing anything?
